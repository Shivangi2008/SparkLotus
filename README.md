### Hi there
# About me
As a CSE student with a strong foundation for Python, I'm excited to keep growing my coding abilities 💪, tackle interesting challenges 🚀, and always deliver my best work! 💯
Outside of tech, I'm into styling 👕, grooming 💇‍♂️, and cooking 🍳. Right now, I'm focusing on staying healthy 🥗 and leveling up my coding skills. 🤓
I seize new opportunities ✨ while maintaining my priorities. ✅ I am open to other fields of work as well.
Right now, I'm really focusing on taking care of my mental well-being 🙏, and it's amazing how much I'm learning about myself every day! 💡 I'm understanding that I'm so much more than just my thoughts and physical self, and that some old beliefs were holding me back from experiencing new things. 🔓 I'm making a conscious effort to be kinder and more compassionate towards myself. ❤️
